# Olympic-data-dashboard
A large dataset regarding olympics, I clean and organise the data and then narrow it down to a specific olympic sport and create a dashboard from it.
 Quick overview:
I firstly made a table and then autofitted the column width, I then went into power query and organised the table for each column and cleaned what I could clean.
I then went back onto excel and now I had 2 tables, the power query table and the original one.
I now decided to filter the olympic sports based on its category, I decided to focus on the boxing category. On the table powerquery table I 
used a technique which helped me filterout every category which didnt have the word 'Boxing', I then organised the table from ascending ID
number of the athelete (I forgot to mention, I also removed the columns which I deemed irrelevant when creating this boxing table)
I then decided whats graphs I was going to make based on this table, I decided to keep it simple and do a graph regarding who won the most gold medals by country.
And 2 other graphs about who won the most silver medals and bronze medal. And a final graph which showed the total metal distrubution.
I then created a filter of the weight class category of the sport so that the graph could find further information of which countries won the most medals
in whatever weight class.
I then fixed the colour scheme, decided what graph was the simplest, easiest to understand at a glance and organised the dashboard page.
