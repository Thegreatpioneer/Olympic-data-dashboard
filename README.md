# Olympic-data-dashboard
For a large dataset regarding the Olympics, I clean and organise the data and then narrow it down to a specific Olympic sport and create a dashboard from it.

Quick overview:

I first made a table and then autofitted the column width, I then went into power query and organised the table for each column, and cleaned what I could clean.
I then went back to excel and now I had 2 tables, the power query table and the original one.

I now decided to filter the Olympic sports based on their category, I decided to focus on the boxing category. On the table power query table I 
used a technique that helped me filter out every category which didnâ€™t have the word 'Boxing', I then organised the table from ascending ID
number of the athletes (I forgot to mention, I also removed the columns which I deemed irrelevant when creating this boxing table)

I then decided what graphs I was going to make based on this table, I decided to keep it simple and do a graph regarding who won the most gold medals by country.

And 2 other graphs about who won the most silver medals and bronze medals. And a final graph that showed the total metal distribution.
I then created a filter of the weight class category of the sport so that the graph could find further information on which countries won the most medals
in whatever weight class.

I then fixed the colour scheme, decided what graph was the simplest, and easiest to understand at a glance, and organised the dashboard page.
